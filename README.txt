Instructions:
    The project requires Python 3.x to run. To run it, simply enter 'python environment.py'. No further user input
    is needed. For each tier of epochs and both limited and limitless deck versions, the program will print that it
    has started running and then again when it finishes the learning phase. It will then run the included tests and
    output several .png files in the root directory containing graphs of the results.

 Requirements:
    To install the libraries needed by the program, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
